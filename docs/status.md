# TeslaUSB B-1 — Build Status (vs. `Requirements.md`)

> **What this is.** The single master checklist of *everything* needed to make
> the B-1 (Rust) solution match [`Requirements.md`](./Requirements.md) — v1's
> features and look-and-feel, re-implemented in Rust, more efficiently, with zero
> clip loss. Every item is a checkbox. **A box is checked ONLY when the behavior
> has been tested end-to-end and proven** (Playwright for UI, hardware-test wrapper
> for device behavior) — not when code merely compiles or an endpoint returns 200.
>
> **Authoritative inputs:** [`Requirements.md`](./Requirements.md) (the baseline),
> [`plan.md`](./plan.md) (honest status + tiers), [`specs/`](./specs/) and
> [`adr/`](./adr/) (locked architecture, incl. [`ADR-0003`](./adr/0003-media-read-path.md)
> media read path).

## Legend

- `[ ]` not done / not yet proven.
- `[x]` **done and tested-successful** (UI: Playwright gate green; device:
  hardware-test wrapper PASS; logic: unit/integration green).
- Tags after an item: **(proven)** verified on hardware/UAT · **(partial)** some
  sub-parts done, behavior not complete · **(stub)** scaffold exists, no live
  behavior · **(gated:X)** blocked on dependency X · **(C)** operator/hardware-only.

## Architecture invariants these items must never violate

1. TeslaCam `lun.0` is **never** disconnected; the car can always write. (One
   bounded, verified exception per Requirements §1.1: an explicit active-chime
   change triggers a brief full re-enumeration that detaches the whole device,
   gated on a health check that recording resumes — no *routine* action may
   disconnect `lun.0`.)
2. Recorded TeslaCam clips are readable for the map (not just the ext4 archive).
3. Media upload/delete may eject **`lun.1` only**, never gating `lun.0`.
4. **All** media (incl. the chime *library* + active `LockChime.wav`) lives in
   the images — never shadow-copied to SD.
5. Reads: media via gadgetd's **RO loop-mount of `media.img`**; live clips via
   raw `pread` (no mount of the car-written volume) — [`ADR-0003`](./adr/0003-media-read-path.md).

## Phase 0 — Foundation slice (DO FIRST; everything below depends on it)

Sequenced as a single vertical slice per the GPT-5.5/mai reviews (do **not** wire
every daemon at once). Get reads + a safe handoff lock proven before feature work.

- [ ] **F1 · 2-image migration on the live device** (single `disk.img` → `lun.0`
  `teslacam.img` + `lun.1` `media.img`). Runbook exists
  ([`usb-io-and-archiving-architecture.md`](./specs/usb-io-and-archiving-architecture.md) §6);
  host-built/bench-validated, **not yet run on the live device**. **(C, gated:C1 spike)**
- [ ] **F2 · Enforce `lun.1 ro=1`** in gadgetd configfs so the car cannot write
  media exFAT metadata (makes the RO-mount sole-writer premise true — GPT-5.5 #9).
- [ ] **F3 · gadgetd RO loop-mount of `media.img`** — persistent, gadgetd-owned;
  exposes a media-root path for `webd` to read via `std::fs`.
- [ ] **F4 · Handoff read-drain / quiesce** — a read-lease so an in-flight media
  read is drained/blocked before a `lun.1` RW mutate; RO mount torn down and
  rebuilt around the handoff (GPT-5.5 #5). Extends the existing handoff state
  machine; "never two writers / never wrong bytes" outranks "always give the
  drive back".
- [ ] **F5 · gadgetd eject-handoff write path (lun.1 only)** — install/delete via
  losetup→mount RW→mutate→sync→umount→re-present, cycling **only** `lun.1`.
  **(partial: handoff mechanism + atomic install + `create_dir_all` parent fix
  proven on the live single-`disk.img` device and on 2-LUN bench; but
  genuine "lun.1-only while lun.0 stays up" is NOT live-proven — live device is
  still single-LUN (F1) — and the ADR-0003 read-drain/RO-remount around the
  write (F4) is not built. gated:F1+F4)**
- [ ] **F6 · scannerd raw `pread` reader + indexd catalog** for both images.
  **(reader + catalog logic proven on ARM bench: clips + 8 media_entries
  cataloged, bench re-validation PASS; NOT yet proven against both LUNs on the
  live device, which still runs single `disk.img`. gated:F1 for the live
  two-image proof)**

---

## 1. Car-facing gadget & storage (`Requirements.md` §1)

- [x] Present as USB Mass Storage gadget (kernel `usb_f_mass_storage`, zero
  userspace in write path). **(proven on hardware)**
- [ ] **Two LUNs** (`lun.0` TeslaCam RW-by-car, `lun.1` Media RO-by-car) live on
  the device. **(partial: host/bench-proven; live device still single disk.img —
  see F1) (gated:C1)**
- [x] Tesla standard TeslaCam folder names (`RecentClips`/`SavedClips`/
  `SentryClips`) recognized; per-event subfolders + `event.json`/`thumb.png`;
  `<ts>-<camera>.mp4` parsing. **(proven: catalog + bench clips)**
- [ ] `TeslaCam/TeslaTrackMode/` recognized in folder lists. **(verify in scannerd
  path allowlist)**
- [ ] Media-drive root layout (`LockChime.wav`, `Boombox/`, `Music/`, `LightShow/`,
  `Chimes/`, `Wraps/`, `LicensePlate/`). **(partial: folder set + `Wraps/`
  root-folder fix proven on the single-`disk.img` device; the layout is not
  proven on a live `media.img` LUN, and `Chimes/`-in-image is still pending —
  see next item. gated:F1+F3)**
- [ ] **Chime library `Chimes/` lives IN `media.img`** (moved off `/data/teslausb/chimes`). **(gated:F3)**
- [ ] Configurable advertised capacity per drive (TeslaCam 64 GB / Media 32 GB
  defaults, 4–2048 GB), fully pre-allocated. **(see §4.11 resize) (gated:C1)**

### 1.1 Change propagation to the car

- [ ] **Soft SCSI medium-change** on `lun.1` after directory changes (new/deleted
  media) — car re-reads listings without re-plug; `lun.0` unaffected. **(port
  `tesla_cache_invalidate.sh` behavior into gadgetd)**
- [ ] **Full USB re-enumeration** ONLY for an active-`LockChime.wav` change, with a
  bounded health check that recording resumes. **(port `tesla_gadget_rebind.sh`)**
- [ ] **Hardware test:** confirm the car actually picks up directory changes via
  soft medium-change, and a chime change via re-enumeration (Requirements §1.1
  is a v1-observed behavior to re-verify on B-1). **(C)**

---

## 2. SMB / network shares (`Requirements.md` §2)

- [ ] Set/change Samba password from the web UI (8–63 chars).
- [ ] Toggle Samba on/off from Settings; top-bar Samba dot reflects state.
- [ ] SMB reads/writes land in the correct folder; car re-reads on next medium-change
  (chime still needs re-enumeration). **(depends on §1.1)**
- [ ] **SMB delete/move** of files directly from Explorer/Finder (drag-out, delete)
  works on both shares (Requirements §2: shares are read-write). **(depends on §2 shares)**

---

## 3. Web UI — global shell (`Requirements.md` §3)

- [x] Single responsive SPA (mobile + desktop), reached at device host. **(proven)**
- [x] Top bar: brand→Map, theme toggle (persisted). **(proven)**

  click→Settings health). **(partial: thin health data — see §4.12/A5)**
- [ ] Samba status dot (shown only when sharing on). **(depends on §2)**
- [ ] Primary nav (sidebar desktop / bottom tabs mobile), availability-gated items. **(partial: nav present; per-feature availability gating to finish — A9)**
- [ ] Feedback model: JSON for AJAX + flash banners; live-poll views. **(partial: proven on media routes; not yet audited across all routes — see §5 error-code audit)**

## 5. Cross-cutting behavior (`Requirements.md` §5)

- [ ] **All media in the images, never on SD.** **(architecture-locked, but NOT
  yet true on disk: chime library still on `/data` and the RO-mount read path
  isn't built — closes when F3 + chime-lib move land)**

  gadgetd `install_file` atomic; `create_dir_all` parent fix proven on hw)**

  never stalling TeslaCam. **(see §1.1)**

---

## 6. B-1 binding requirements + hardware gates (`Requirements.md` §6)

- [ ] **#1** TeslaCam never disconnected. **(partial: media handoff cycles lun.1
  only on bench; NOT proven on the live device, which is still single-LUN —
  gated:F1+C1)**
- [ ] **#2** Recorded (live) TeslaCam clips readable for the map. **(gated:B1 then lun.0 ReadFile)**
- [ ] **#3** Media upload/delete ejects lun.1 only. **(partial: bench-proven;
  gated:F1+C1 for the live second LUN, and F4 read-drain)**
- [ ] **#4** All media in images incl. chime library. **(gated:F3 + chime-lib move)**
- [ ] **#5** Reproduce every v1 capability + look-and-feel, lower CPU/I/O/mem, zero clip loss. **(the whole list above)**

### Tier-C hardware/operator gates (block multiple items; cannot be done autonomously)

- [ ] **C1 · 2.1 LUN-acceptance vehicle spike** — does the car accept a SECOND
  read-only media LUN? Make-or-break; unblocks all calibration + F1. **(C)**
- [ ] **C2 · WiFi TX-cap (2.6) + governor defaults (2.7)** at-vehicle. **(C)**
- [ ] **C3 · Real Tesla footage validation** (replace synthetic SMPTE). **(C)**
- [ ] **C4 · Push held commits + port-80 + live deploy.** **(C)**
- [ ] **C5 · Security ruling on rclone-key write exposure** (blocks B3 config-write). **(C)**
- [ ] **C6 · Car change-propagation verification** (§1.1 soft vs full re-enum). **(C)**

---

## Recommended build order (folds in the review guidance)

> **C1 is make-or-break and comes FIRST.** The entire two-image / `lun.1`-media
> direction (and therefore F1 migration, the RO `media.img` mount, and every
> "lun.1-only" safety claim) is invalid if the car won't accept a second
> read-only LUN. Run the C1 vehicle spike up front. Bench development of the
> Phase-0 slice (F2–F4) and the Lock-Chimes UI can proceed **in parallel** on the
> bench, but nothing media may be marked proven on the live device until C1 + F1
> pass.

0. **C1 · 2.1 LUN-acceptance vehicle spike (FIRST, blocking the direction).**
   If PASS → proceed to F1 migration. If FAIL → re-open the media-LUN
   architecture before building further.
1. **Phase 0 foundation slice** (F2→F3→F4) — `lun.1 ro=1` + RO media mount +
   handoff read-drain. Develop on the bench in parallel with C1; lands live after
   F1. Unlocks every media *read* (active-chime player, library/music/boombox/
   lightshow playback, wrap/plate thumbnails) with simple `std::fs`.
2. **Fix Lock Chimes page** (§4.5 active card + library playback) — first visible
   win on the new read path; highest current divergence from v1.
3. **retentiond serve loop (B1)** → archive RecentClips → unblocks live-clip map
   playback (§4.2 #2) and storage-health/analytics alerts.
4. **lun.0 `ReadFile` fallback** (only the not-yet-archived window) — small, per
   the simplified [`contracts/scannerd-readfile.md`](./specs/contracts/scannerd-readfile.md).
5. **Media write parity remainder** (chunked/multi upload, music folder ops,
   lightshow ZIP, plate cropper) — needs the multi-file gadgetd op.
6. **SMB (§2) + Settings (§4.15) + Storage Settings (§4.11/B5).**
7. **uploadd/cloud (B3, gated C5) · wifid/captive portal (B4, WiFi-gated) ·
   chime enforcement loop (A3d) · Failed Jobs richness (A8/B7).**
8. **Remaining Tier-C at-vehicle (after C1):** migration F1 → calibration C2 →
   real-footage C3 → change-propagation C6.
